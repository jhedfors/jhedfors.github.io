      <h2><a href="http://54.211.7.176" target="_blank">Quotable Quotes</a></h2>
      <p>
        Purpose: Collect favorite quotes.

        This project is earned me a 'black belt' for the Python stack. To earn a 'black belt', you must complete and deploy the project to AWS within 4.5 hrs, while satisfying 95% of the functionality contained within a supplied wireframe. I subsequently added additional functionality to delete your own entry if it has not been favorited by anyone yet, as well as using a modal to create the new entry.

        This project is earned me a 'red belt' for the LAMP stack. To earn a 'red belt', you must complete and deploy the project to AWS within 4.5 hrs, while satisfying 80% of the functionality contained within a supplied wireframe (I was just shy of %95 which is the threshold for a 'black belt'). I subsequently added additional functionality to quickly mark an appointment as 'done', as well as using a modal to create the new appointment.
