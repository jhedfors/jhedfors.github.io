<h2>Handling Criticism</h2>
<p class="Text">Now let&rsquo;s look at another situation. Maybe you&rsquo;ve had an experience like Juanita&rsquo;s:</p>
<p class="Text">Juanita just got a paper back from her instructor and she is disappointed in her grade. When she reads the paper, she finds an overwhelming number of comments. As she starts to read the comments, she realizes that her paper did not meet the instructor&rsquo;s expectations. Juanita is devastated because she spent at least ten hours working on the paper. How could she have been so far off the mark? First she decides that this professor is simply too hard to please. Then, she starts to doubt her own abilities as a student.</p>
<p class="Text">Juanita has taken the feedback that her instructor has provided too personally. Juanita can benefit from her professor&rsquo;s criticism in positive ways. Let&rsquo;s take a look at several methods to handle criticism constructively.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Distance yourself from the criticism.</strong> No matter what the situation is, try to distance yourself from the criticism as if there is an imaginary wall of Plexiglas between you and the person. In doing so, you can become emotionally detached. You can glean valuable information when looking at the situation from an observational standpoint. If Juanita were to take on the role of a detached observer, she would find valuable information in her instructor&rsquo;s comments.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Ask for clarification and specifics.</strong> If Juanita does not understand a comment, she should ask the professor to elaborate. She might ask the professor to refer her to a specific page in the textbook to support his feedback.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Decide on a response.</strong> It is important to respond appropriately to the criticizer. In what ways do you agree with what the criticizer said to you? Find ways to agree with the criticizer. Sometimes you may need to apologize if you have offended someone.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Look for a pattern in terms of other criticism.</strong> Has anyone else ever addressed this problem with you? The more times you hear the same criticism, the more likely it is to be valid. For example, if three supervisors have told you that you don&rsquo;t follow through in getting your work done, the criticism is most likely valid. Juanita should take care to note if other professors are responding to her work with similar corrections.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Disarm the opposition.</strong> You have an opportunity to either acknowledge the constructive criticism or continue the same patterns. If you deny the criticism, the problem will most likely persist. But if you can accept the feedback, you will be able to resolve the issues with the other person. The best thing Juanita can do is accept her professor&rsquo;s comments and work to improve based on the feedback she received. If she receives the professor&rsquo;s criticism constructively, she will become a better learner and her academic experience will be more valuable. Agreeing with criticism from a person with formal authority over you is effective because in doing so, you are then in a position to ask for his or her help to improve the situation.</li>
