<h2>Conflict-Management Styles</h2>
<p class="Text">There is more than one way to deal with conflict. Kenneth Thomas (1976) identified five. Before we discuss these five styles, it is important to understand that there is no right or wrong style. To be interpersonally effective, you must choose the best conflict management style to deal with the situation at hand. Each style may be effective in certain situations, but inappropriate in other situations. It is important to know the drawbacks for each style.</p>
<p class="Text">The <strong>competitive style</strong> is a desire to win at the expense of the other party, or to dominate. It might be appropriate to use this style of conflict management when you don&rsquo;t want to be taken advantage of and you need to stand up for your rights. However, the drawback to this style is that conflict can escalate out of control and the loser may retaliate.</p>
<p class="Text">The <strong>accommodative style</strong> is a desire to satisfy the other party at the expense of your own satisfaction. It is appropriate to use this style when you don&rsquo;t have much experience with the issue surrounding the conflict. Or, you may use this style if you are concerned about the outcome of the conflict. People who resort to this style on a regular basis are selfless and obedient. The drawback to this style of conflict resolution is that if using this style leaves your desires unmet, you could develop harbored resentment.</p>
<p class="Text">The <strong>sharing style</strong> is when both parties agree to a compromise in order to resolve the conflict. In this situation, both people lose something. It is appropriate to use this style to save time or to reach a settlement agreement. The drawback to this style of conflict resolution is that the parties may have to compromise important values to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="Text">The <strong>collaborative style</strong> is when both parties gain something of benefit or value in the conflict. It is a win-win situation for both people. It is appropriate to use this style when you and the other party must be committed to a solution. For example, parents going through a divorce may demonstrate a collaborative approach where they avoid going to court. This leads to a win-win situation for both people.</p>
<p class="Text">The <strong>avoidant style</strong> is when one of the parties ignores the other party&rsquo;s concerns in order to avoid conflict. This person is both uncooperative and unassertive. It may be appropriate to use this style when the situation can be resolved without your involvement, or when you think that others might be able to take responsibility. You might also choose to use this style if you need more time to think about how to respond, if you feel that confrontation will hurt the relationship, or if there is little chance of satisfying your needs. However, the drawback to this style is that the other person may perceive you as uncaring. The other person may become angry or resentful toward you.</p>
