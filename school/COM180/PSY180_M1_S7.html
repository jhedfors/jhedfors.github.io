<h2>Mindfulness</h2>
<p class="Text">Our third component of interpersonal effectiveness is mindfulness. Often, the concept of mindfulness is discussed within the context of meditation, though mindfulness is not just about meditating. Mindfulness is a manner of acting and interacting with your immediate environment. It is the ability to focus on your experience in the present moment and be aware of your own reactions. People who are mindful demonstrate an awareness of their own emotions and the reactions that they provoke in others. They are also able to recognize the emotions of others and to respond in ways that enable them to adapt to moderate challenging situations. For example, a person who is mindful would recognize that a friend was feeling angry, upset, or frustrated and regulate his or her response to the friend. Instead of escalating the situation, the mindful friend might practice reflective listening or offer soothing comments. Someone less mindful might inflame the situation by becoming angry or upset as well.</p>
<p class="Text">People who are mindful are able to be open and focused on their experiences, while also being able to recognize when they have failed and when they are successful. They take that knowledge from their present experience and use that to guide their future behavior.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Characteristics of Mindfulness</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Can you think of a time when you were able to regulate your emotions so that you could help someone else? Or a time when you were unable to do so and the situation escalated? Which would you consider the more effective technique?</p>
<p class="Text">Characteristics of mindfulness include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">High levels of &ldquo;self-monitoring&rdquo;</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Awareness of surroundings and interactions</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Use of information obtained from the environment</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">A&nbsp;lack of mindfulness includes:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Neglecting new information</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Determining current behavior based upon past experiences</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Using minimal information to process and understand information</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Monitoring, Mindfulness, and Interpersonal Effectiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">When a person self-monitors and is mindful, he or she:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Behaves appropriately in social and professional situations</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Bases his or her behavior on situations</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Controls his or her facial expressions and body language</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">Individuals who have good interpersonal effectiveness skills also have the ability to self-monitor and demonstrate high levels of mindfulness. Communicating with mindfulness:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Leads to awareness of your environment</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Results in openness to new information</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Improves perceptual processes</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Enhances awareness of perspectives</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Allows you to respond more consciously</li>
</ul>
