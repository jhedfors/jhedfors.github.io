<h2><strong>The Communication Process</strong></h2>
<p class="Text">To have satisfying and long-term relationships in your personal and professional life, you must be able to communicate effectively. For example, a customer service representative cannot resolve a thorny customer problem without carefully receiving and sending information. People who are interpersonally effective in relationships are able to reduce communication problems. First, you must understand the basic communication process and its seven elements.</p>
<p class="Text">There is a <em>sender</em> or source. The sender is the person who is attempting to speak or write to another person. The <em>message</em> is the purpose or idea that the sender is attempting to convey. The <em>channel</em> used may be a certain type of media; it may be spoken words or it may be a nonverbal signal or gesture. The <em>receiver</em> is the person who gets the message and understands it correctly.</p>
<p class="Text">Remember from <strong>Module 2</strong> that perceptual distortions may act as filters and prevent a message from being received as intended by the sender. Next, <em>feedback</em> happens when the receiver sends a message back to the sender and acknowledges an understanding of the message. It might be only a simple reaction, such as &ldquo;okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text">Another factor in the communication process is the <em>environment</em>. Environment affects the sender, the receiver, and how the message is communicated.</p>
<p class="Text">Finally, <em>noise</em> influences the communication process. You will recall from <strong>Module 2</strong> that distractions have a pervasive influence on perception. Noise is anything that disrupts communication, including the attitudes and emotions of the receiver. Noise includes such factors as stress, fear, negative attitudes, and low motivation.</p>
