<h2>Influences on Perception</h2>
<p class="Text">The foundation of a house is the basis of the frame and supports the walls, floors, ceilings, and all other components; the foundation supports the structure. A well-built house will withstand storms and strains and protect the people who dwell in it.</p>
<p class="Text">If you think of your mind as a construction site, then the foundation was laid when you were very young and the frame developed as you grew older. Each person&rsquo;s &ldquo;foundation and frame&rdquo; are different. Many different personal experiences influenced the formation of our foundation and frame and therefore affect our perception of both ourselves and of others. These influences are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Physiological</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Psychological</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Social/cultural</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text"><span class="SubTitle">Physiological Influences</span></p>
<p class="Text">Physiological influences are things such as age, health, fatigue, or hunger. Perceptions tend to change with these physiological factors. You might know that you are more impatient when you are hungry or that you have difficulty focusing when you are tired.</p>
<p class="Text">Perception differences also happen among age groups. For example, an older person might think it&rsquo;s rude to text someone when you&rsquo;re with someone else while a younger person might consider it normal. To the older person, the face-to-face interaction is more important; the younger person sees texting as a primary means of communication.</p>
<p class="Text">Someone with a health problem that impairs his breathing might believe a friend smoking near him is uncaring, while the smoker might not understand the illness and the impact of that behavior.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="SubTitle">Psychological Influences</span></p>
<p class="Text">Psychological influences also affect a person&rsquo;s perception. Our emotional state, or mood, strongly influences how we interpret things and in turn, how we communicate with others. For example, when we are in a bad mood, we may be more likely to perceive interactions negatively.</p>
<p class="Text">Our self-concept, or our understanding of ourselves, influences how we perceive situations. If we know and can recognize our own common misinterpretations, we can watch for and correct them in our perceptual processes.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="SubTitle">Social/Cultural Influences</span></p>
<p class="Text">Social influences affect all components of the perceptual process. They provide your personal viewpoint and the filter through which you receive what happens in the world.</p>
<p class="Text">Inequalities between social groups create differences in individual viewpoints and influence the communication process. How people deal with, organize, interpret, and respond to others is all related to their individual viewpoints. A woman might interpret a man holding the door open for her as old-fashioned while the man might view it as being a polite, respectful, cultural practice.</p>
<p class="Text">Psychological sex types, which are the masculine and feminine sex traits, also influence the perceptual process. Society dictates gender roles and the expectation of gender-specific behavior. People notice when individuals do not subscribe to the roles as expected, and they may react to those individuals based on that perception.</p>
