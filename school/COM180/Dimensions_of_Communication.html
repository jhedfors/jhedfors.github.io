<h2>Dimensions of Communication</h2>
<p class="Text">Communication is also a vehicle for building relationships. According to Sorenson, DeBord, and Ramirez (2001), we establish relationships along two primary dimensions: dominant-subordinate and cold-warm.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Dominate vs. Subordinate</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">In the process of communicating, we attempt to dominate or to subordinate. When we dominate, we attempt to control communication. When we subordinate, we attempt to yield control, or think first of the wishes and needs of the other person. Dominators expect the receiver of messages to submit to them; subordinate people send a signal that they expect the other person to dominate (Sorenson, DeBord, &amp; Ramirez, 2001).</p>
<p class="Text">For example, a dominator might speak loudly or enthusiastically, write forceful messages in all capital letters or filled with exclamation points, or gesture with exaggerated, rapid hand movements. He or she might write a harsh e-mail message such as &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time you start taking this class seriously and turn in your work for the group project.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text">A subordinate person might speak quietly and hesitantly, in a meek tone. A subordinate person might ask, &ldquo;I know you have better things on your mind than to worry about our group project, but I was wondering when I can expect to receive your research for the group work?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Cold vs. Warm</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">The cold-warm dimension also shapes communication because we invite the same behavior that we send. Cold, impersonal, negative messages evoke similar messages from others. In contrast, warm verbal and nonverbal messages evoke similar responses from others. Here is a an example of a cold versus warm response from a classmate:</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Colder:</strong> I&rsquo;m not responsible for writing the bibliography. You&rsquo;ll need to contact Susan since that is her job in the class project.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Warmer:</strong> I understand your concern about the bibliography. Susan might be able to address your concern since she has worked extensively on this. Let&rsquo;s ask her to explain.</p>
<p class="Text">The combination of <em>dominant</em> and <em>cold</em> communication sends the signal that the sender of the message wants to control, limit, or even withdraw from a personal relationship. Subordinate actions combined with warm communication signal a desire to maintain or build the relationship while yielding to the other person.</p>
<p class="Text">Figure 4-2 summarizes how the dual dimensions of <em>dominant-subordinate</em> and <em>cold-warm</em> influence the relationship-building aspects of communication. Rather than regarding these four quadrants of relationships as good or bad, think of your purpose. In some situations, you might want to dominate and be cold. In other situations, you might want to submit a little and be warm in order to build a relationship.</p>
<p class="Text">Observe that the person in the <em>dominant-cold</em> quadrant has an impersonal relationship with the receiver, and the person in the <em>warm-subordinate</em> quadrant has a supportive relationship with the receiver. Being dominant and warm leads to a personal relationship, whereas being subordinate and cold leads to an accepting relationship. The combinations of dominant-cold and warm-subordinate are more likely to produce the results indicated.</p>
