<h2>Nurturing vs. Toxic People</h2>
<p class="Text">Have you ever been around someone in your family or at work who came along and knocked the happy wind out of your sails? We&rsquo;ve all experienced someone like that in our lives. Now, consider the people whom you enjoy being around. We all want to be around these people because they are well-adjusted, happy, healthy-minded individuals.</p>
<p class="Text">A major strategy for mentoring, coaching, and training others is to develop a nurturing approach to people. A nurturing person is positive and promotes the growth of others. On the other hand, a toxic person tends to have a negative focus.</p>
<p class="Text">Consider the following scenario:</p>
<p class="Text">Alvaro is experiencing difficulty at work and in his personal life. He approaches his coworkers, Tawanda and Danielle, and says, &ldquo;What a day! I just got a rotten performance review. If my work doesn&rsquo;t improve within a month, I may get fired. Plus my fianc&eacute;e has threatened to dump me if I don&rsquo;t get a big raise or a promotion. My hard drive crashed and I lost all my music, photos, and homework assignments. My whole world is collapsing!&rdquo; <br /> <br /> Danielle responds, &ldquo;Alvaro, you don&rsquo;t need to take nonsense like that from your supervisor. People around here don&rsquo;t value you. Don&rsquo;t let them get at you like that! Your fianc&eacute;e sounds like a piece of work. You should break up with her first! If I were in your shoes, I&rsquo;d start looking for another job right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text">Tawanda responds, &ldquo;Alvaro, I know you feel like the whole world is falling down around you right now, but it&rsquo;s not. Take a deep breath. What&rsquo;s the most important thing right now? If you could fix one broken thing, where would you start?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text">You can guess from this scenario which person is toxic to Alvaro and which person is nurturing to Alvaro. If Alvaro listens to toxic people like Danielle long enough, he&rsquo;ll feel depressed and drained. If Alvaro listens to people like Tawanda, he&rsquo;ll feel supported.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="SubTitle">Becoming More Nurturing</span></p>
<p class="Text">You may be wondering how you can become a more nurturing person. Being nurturing means that you promote the growth of others. Three actions/attitudes support being a nurturing person:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Recognize that most people have growth needs. Most every person that you have contact with throughout your day has a need for self-fulfillment in some capacity. Engage others in conversations where you can share information that you have learned about work, your social setting, etc., that would help them feed their growth need.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Team up with a friend to form a buddy system. You and your buddy can keep each other informed about decisions that are being made that could potentially affect your goals. This type of information sharing can lead to new opportunities for you and your buddy&mdash;simply by sharing your knowledge with an interested partner.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Be a role model for others. A great way to be a nurturing person is to behave in ways that others would want to model. To be the type of role model that others want to follow, you need to exhibit these qualities:<br /> <br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Strong work ethic</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Job expertise</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Nurturing personality</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Speaking ability</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Professional appearance</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Ethical behavior</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">Based on these three actions, do you qualify yet, or do you need to continue working on it?</p>
