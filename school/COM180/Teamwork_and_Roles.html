<h2>Teamwork and Roles</h2>
<p class="Text">Part of being interpersonally effective involves effectively participating in group work. As an online student, you may need to participate in virtual teams where you do most of your collaborative work by electronic communication. In the business environment, you will need to work on face-to-face teams. All teams have the common elements of people working together cooperatively and members possessing a mix of skills. Each team member&rsquo;s broad purpose is to contribute to a collaborative environment.</p>
<p class="Text">A major challenge in learning to become an effective team member is to choose the right roles to occupy. A &ldquo;role&rdquo; is a tendency to behave, contribute, and relate to others in a particular way. If you carry out positive roles, you will be perceived as a contributor to the team effort. If you neglect carrying out these roles, you will be perceived as a poor contributor. Let&rsquo;s look at the members of one team and their various roles.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Creative Problem Solver and Resource Investigator Roles</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Sally is her team&rsquo;s creative problem solver. She solves difficult problems for her group. Sally&rsquo;s potential weakness as the creative problem solver is that she tends to ignore fine details and gets too immersed in the problem to communicate effectively.</p>
<p class="Text">William is his team&rsquo;s resource investigator. He is extraverted, enthusiastic, and communicates freely with other team members. He explores opportunities and develops valuable contacts. William&rsquo;s potential weakness as a resource investigator is that he can be overly optimistic at the beginning, and may lose interest after the initial enthusiasm wanes.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Coordinator and Shaper Roles</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Mindy is a team coordinator. She is mature, confident, and a natural team leader. She clarifies goals, promotes decision making, and delegates effectively. A downside to Mindy&rsquo;s role is that she might seem manipulative and controlling. Mindy may delegate too much by asking others to do some of the work she should be doing.</p>
<p class="Text">Dan is a team shaper. He is challenging and dynamic and thrives under pressure. He will use determination and courage to overcome obstacles. Dan&rsquo;s potential weakness as a shaper is that he can be easily provoked and may ignore the feelings of others.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Team Worker and Implementer Roles</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Jennifer is a team worker. She is cooperative. She focuses on relationships and is sensitive and diplomatic. She is a good listener and builds relationships, dislikes confrontation, and averts friction. Jennifer&rsquo;s potential weakness is that she can be indecisive in a crunch situation or a crisis.</p>
<p class="Text">Joe is an implementer. He is disciplined, reliable, conservative, and efficient. He acts quickly on ideas and converts them into practical action. Joe&rsquo;s potential weakness as an implementer can be that he may be inflexible and slow to see new opportunities.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Completer-Finisher and Specialist Roles</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Tara is the completer-finisher. She is conscientious and eager to get the job done. She has a good eye for detail and is effective at searching out errors. She can be counted on to finish a project and deliver on time. Her potential weakness as a completer-finisher is that she can worry too much and be hesitant to delegate.</p>
<p class="Text">Craig is the specialist. He is single-minded. He is a self-starter. He is dedicated and provides knowledge and skill in needed areas. Craig&rsquo;s potential weakness is that he can be stuck in his niche with little interest in other knowledge and he may dwell on technicalities.</p>
