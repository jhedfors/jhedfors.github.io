<h2><b>Perceived Control</b></h2>
<p class="Text">Coaching may also include mentoring and modeling stress management techniques. Some people have a personal predisposition to stress. In other words, they experience stress because of the way they have learned to cope. A person who believes that he is unable to control the outcomes of a situation is more likely to experience depression or give up.</p>
<p class="Text">Research has shown that individuals with <em>low perceived control</em> are more prone to stress than are individuals with <em>high perceived control</em>. Let&rsquo;s look at an example.</p>
<p class="Text">Homeowners Martin and Jeffrey have just experienced a devastating hurricane in their eastern coastal town. Their homes were extensively damaged. Martin sees the situation as completely hopeless. He thinks that there is no way he will ever recover. However, Jeffrey is eager to clean up and start rebuilding. He realizes that he has the ability to rebuild his life and his town, one day at a time. He imagines that in a year or two, they will be thriving once again.</p>
<p class="Text">Both Martin and Jeffrey have perceived control. Based on the theory of low perceived control, which person is more likely to have a disposition to stress based on his perceived control? If you guessed Martin, you are correct. Martin has low perceived control and is more likely to experience the physical and psychological symptoms of stress.</p>
