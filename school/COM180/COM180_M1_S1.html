<h2><b>Course Introduction</b></h2>
<p class="Text">Welcome to COM180&mdash;Interpersonal Effectiveness. This course highlights the theories and skills considered essential to interpersonal effectiveness across a variety of contexts and relationships. Interpersonal effectiveness comprises many individual skills, which we can categorize into four primary skill sets: competence, emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and ethical behavior. This course will offer a framework for interpersonal skill development through examination of topics such as perception, identity, personality, perspective taking, cultural influences on relationships and human interactions, listening, assertive communication, providing feedback, conflict styles, and conflict management.</p>
<p class="Text">Think for a moment about what the term &ldquo;interpersonal effectiveness&rdquo; means to you. Take some time to consider the current state of your relationships with friends, loved ones, family members, coworkers, fellow students, and so on. What does a strong and positive relationship look like within your own personal and professional life? Where do you find frustrations and miscommunications arising in your relationships? Have you ever considered how you could improve the relationships in your own life? These are important questions because relationships are at the very core of human existence and daily life.</p>
<p class="Text">Over the next five modules, you will examine human interactions from a relational perspective and reflect on your own level of interpersonal effectiveness in class discussions, journal assignments, learning assessments, and a course project. Regardless of the profession you currently are involved in or pursuing, you will be better equipped for success if you better understand human relationships and interpersonal effectiveness. Throughout this course, you will be challenged to examine how your behaviors and perspectives influence your personal and professional relationships. You will study how the actions of others in turn influence your behaviors in those relationships. You will examine your current relational framework and be asked to practice a variety of interpersonal effectiveness skills.</p>
