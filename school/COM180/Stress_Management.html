<h2>Stress Management</h2>
<p class="Text">Stress is an inevitable part of the college experience. <a href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/pls/us/edmc/21271743576/redirect/index.php?id=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This video</a> explores the different types of stress, both academically and personally. It also offers advice on how you can combat the different types of stressors so that you can be successful both personally and academically.</p>
<p class="Text">Unless managed properly, stress may lead to harmful long-term consequences such as disabling illness and career lapse. Mandy&rsquo;s story shows several techniques for reducing stress.</p>
<p class="Text">Mandy is stressed about the prospects of losing her job. She begins to think, &ldquo;Would losing this job really be that bad? If this job folds, I could move to Seattle where I&rsquo;ve always wanted to live, and restart my career.&rdquo; Mandy is changing overly pessimistic thinking to more optimistic thinking. She is rethinking the belief she has about a stressful situation.</p>
<p class="Text">Mandy&rsquo;s doctor recommends physical exercise as one way to combat stress. She has been sedentary due to working 40 hours behind a desk. The doctor recommends a combination of both yoga and aerobic exercise. Mandy decides to join her local gym. After a few months of regular physical exercise, Mandy starts to feel better. The endorphins that she gets from physical exercise are produced in the thalamus portion of the brain and they work like painkillers to reduce stress (DuBrin, p. 365).</p>
<p class="Text">Mandy reports that she has been eating foods high in sugar and caffeine. Her doctor explains that she should be eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and foods low in saturated fats. Mandy uses MyPyramid, the government&rsquo;s personalized diet program, to maintain a healthy diet.</p>
<p class="Text">A support network is a group of people who can listen to your problems and provide emotional support. Mandy sets out to find a workout partner who is also a good listener.</p>
