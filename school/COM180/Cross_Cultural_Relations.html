<h2><strong>Cross-Cultural Relations</strong></h2>
<p class="Text">Understanding culture is increasingly important in our personal and professional lives. Culture is the language, values, beliefs, traditions, and customs that groups of people share and learn. With emerging technology, people who live thousands of miles apart are able to come together through the telephone and Internet.</p>
<p class="Text">Economic globalization has also created opportunities to bring people of different cultures together. Understanding other cultures is important to enhancing both intercultural communication and effective partnerships. The United States is increasingly expanding its cultural and ethnic diversity. Worldwide, the workforce is becoming more diverse as well. It is important to note that a main reason that international business partnerships, peace meetings, and sometimes even personal relationships fail is lack of attention to cultural factors. Globalization has made the need to study culture very important.</p>
<p class="Text">Developing a successful level of competence when communicating with members of cultures that are different from your own has several important components.</p>
<p class="Text">To develop your knowledge and skills, you have to learn about other cultures and their various cultural norms and codes of conduct. These steps are critical for becoming culturally competent and for creating an environment of openness where people can come together and understand one another.</p>
<p class="Text">A critical step for developing cultural competence is open-mindedness. This means checking your ethnocentrism, prejudice, and stereotypes at the door.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">In this increasingly diverse global environment, an <strong>ethnocentric</strong> attitude that considers one person&rsquo;s culture to be superior to another&rsquo;s is not conducive to positive communication.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Prejudice</strong>, an unfair and intolerant attitude towards an out-group, must be avoided.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Stereotyping</strong>, or applying a set of beliefs to all members of a group, can be hazardous when dealing with any cultural group.</li>
