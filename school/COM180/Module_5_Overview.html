<p class="Text">How do you deal with conflict? Everyone has a different approach. Some people don&rsquo;t like conflict, so they will put aside their hurts and feelings to simply avoid it at all cost. Others face it head on.</p>
<p class="Text">How do you deal with stress? Some people find comfort in food; others need to exercise.</p>
<p class="Text">Regardless of how you deal with conflict and stress, one thing is certain&mdash;we all feel them. You have spent the last four modules learning about topics like interpersonal communication, motivation, listening, personality, culture, and teamwork. All of these pieces play a vital role in a person&rsquo;s interpersonal effectiveness. So it is no mistake that we will spend the last module talking about managing conflict and stress. Because difficult situations are inevitable, it is important to learn to manage them effectively.</p>
<p class="Text">People typically handle conflict and stress through behavior they&rsquo;ve learned over a lifetime of examples and experiences. What we&rsquo;ve seen modeled and our own experiences (good and bad) with conflict shape how we respond as adults today.</p>
<p class="Text">Though avoiding conflict might seem to work, it&rsquo;s not a good method to use because hurt that isn&rsquo;t addressed will accumulate and create an even bigger conflict in the long run. This module, we will look at how you can better manage difficult situations in your life and learn strategies for managing your own stress.</p>
