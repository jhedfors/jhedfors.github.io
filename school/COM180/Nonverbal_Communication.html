<h2>Nonverbal Communication</h2>
<p class="Text">A substantial amount of communication between people takes place at the nonverbal level. Nonverbal communication refers to the transmission of messages through means other than words. These messages accompany verbal messages or sometimes stand alone. The general purpose of nonverbal communication is to communicate the feeling behind a message.</p>
<p class="Text">To illustrate, stand in front of a mirror and say &ldquo;No&rdquo; with a clenched fist. What do you think the nonverbal message communicates when you say &ldquo;No&rdquo; with a clenched fist? Now, say &ldquo;No&rdquo; with a smile. How is your smile communicating differently from the clenched fist?</p>
<p class="Text">You can see from this exercise that the clenched fist communicates a higher level of intensity, while the smile communicates a warm and positive feeling. Nonverbal communication has a powerful position in the communication process.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Modes of Nonverbal Communication</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Nonverbal communication can be transmitted in many modes. The setting or <em>environment</em> in which you send a message can influence how that message is received. If your boss takes you to an upscale restaurant for lunch, you may think the topic is more important than if he were to take you to the company cafeteria for a conversation.</p>
<p class="Text">How you place your body in relation to someone else, what we call <em>interpersonal distance</em>, is widely used to transmit messages. You would probably stand closer to a loved one than you would to a co-worker. Putting your arm around someone is usually friendly, yet in a job environment, it might be considered sexual harassment. Sitting across the table from someone during a business meeting might be defensive or intimidating, whereas sitting side by side leads to a more relaxed and comfortable discussion.</p>
<p class="Text"><em>Posture</em> also communicates a variety of messages. Standing erect communicates confidence whereas slumping over may communicate a lack of self-confidence. Additionally, <em>hand </em><em>gestures</em> communicate clues as to a person&rsquo;s level of dominance or submission. Using your <em>head</em>, <em>face</em>, and <em>eyes</em> in combination provides the clearest indication of interpersonal attitudes. Maintaining eye contact with another person improves communication. Moving your face and eyes away from the other person is often interpreted as a sign of defensiveness or lack of self-confidence. Often, more significance is attached to the <em>way</em> something is said than to <em>what</em> is said. A forceful <em>voice</em>, which includes a consistent tone without vocalized pauses, connotes power and control. Volume, pitch, and the rate of speaking all help to communicate boredom, joy, anger, happiness, frustration, and other feelings.</p>
<p class="Text">Finally, your <em>personal appearance</em> plays an important role in communicating messages to others. People pay more respect and grant more privileges to those they perceive as being well dressed and neatly groomed.</p>
