<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p class="Text">How well do you understand people? Do you understand the choices that they make even when they differ from the ones that you might make? Or does it seem like the people around you are incomprehensible?</p>
<p class="Text">Your ability to understand others is important to your interpersonal effectiveness. When you understand others, you are better able to interpret their behavior and motivations and find it easier to communicate with them.</p>
<p class="Text">In this module, we will discuss the four kinds of motivating factors that influence the choices people make:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Physical</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Psychological</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Social/Cultural</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Cognitive</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">Let&rsquo;s consider each kind.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Physical:</strong> These motivators influence behaviors that support our survival and comfort. Communication allows us to take care of our physical needs, such as obtaining food or getting medical help if necessary. The first thing that humans learn how to communicate is their physical needs. Babies cry to indicate that they are hungry, need to sleep, or that they need a new diaper.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Psychological:</strong> Psychological motivators include emotional and identity motivators. These motivators provide us with the drive to ensure our emotional security and identity development. We use communication to convey our emotional state and to obtain emotional support from others. When we are upset, we can use verbal and non-verbal communication to elicit sympathy or comfort from a loved one.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Social/Cultural:</strong> Many social and cultural factors affect our behavior. Communication is often driven by societal and cultural expectations. For example, in some cultures, you are expected to show a lot of attention to brand new babies and their parents, even if you don&rsquo;t know the family or particularly like babies.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Cognitive:</strong> Our behavior is influenced by our cognitive process. Most of the time when we engage in communication, some kind of cognition or <em>thinking</em> goes into the behavior. Even if the original drive to communicate is to have a need taken care of, we think about the best way of communicating to have the need met. The thoughts that we have both drive our own communication to others and help us interpret communication directed at us.</p>
<p class="Text">See how well you understand these motivators by completing these activities.</p>
