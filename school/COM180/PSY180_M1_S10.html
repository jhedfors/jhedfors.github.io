<h2>Ethics</h2>
<p class="Text">The fourth component of interpersonal effectiveness is ethics. The other components focus on personal and interpersonal behaviors, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter how competent, emotionally intelligent, and mindful you are if you are not ethical in your choices. Ethics describe our standards for right and wrong, good and bad, and moral and immoral. Every time you make a choice, either in your communication or in your behavior, you need to consider the ethical ramifications of that choice. Is it right or wrong? How does it affect the people with whom you are interacting?</p>
<p class="Text">For example, suppose you are told that there will be layoffs at the company where you work. Others do not know this information, and you have been instructed not to tell anyone about the upcoming layoffs. Then your best friend, who works with you at this company, tells you that she has gotten a job offer with another company, but she is thinking about turning it down. What should you do? Should you tell your friend so she will accept the job offer? Or should you keep quiet?</p>
