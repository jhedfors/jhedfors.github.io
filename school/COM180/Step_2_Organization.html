<h2><b>The Four Steps</b></h2>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Selection</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">When we communicate with others, we are exposed to far more sensory input than we realize. Therefore, we must select what stimuli we can manage. Your selections are influenced by the type of stimuli, your personal motivation, and your emotional state.</p>
<p class="Text">People pay more attention to stimuli that are bigger, brighter, or louder. When you are in a noisy restaurant, it is easier to listen to a person speaking loudly enough to stand out from the background noise. People also notice stimuli that suddenly changes. Parents have a knack for knowing when their children are getting into something troublesome&mdash;often the children suddenly become quiet.</p>
<p class="Text">A preconceived notion about how someone is likely to act motivates a person to attend to (pay attention to) stimuli that support that bias. For example, a schoolteacher who believes that boys are better at math than girls are more likely to notice a male student who is excelling in math.</p>
<p class="Text">Finally, mood influences what we attend to. Imagine that you&rsquo;ve had a really bad day at work. You meet two friends after work for happy hour and learn that one of them also had a bad day. Most likely, your conversation will focus on talking about your bad days and neither mood will improve!</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Organization</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">To make sense of our world, we must organize the stimuli that we have attended to. We use perceptual schemas (plans) to organize the communication data that we are exposed to.</p>
<p class="Text">When interacting with other people, we classify them based on their physical characteristics such as how similar they are to us, or how attractive they are. People tend to interact more easily with people whom they perceive as being similar to them.</p>
<p class="Text">We also classify the people based on their roles, such as student, teacher, parent, or supervisor. When we interact with people we perceive to have higher social status than we have, we accord them a certain amount of respect solely because of this perceived status. For example, when you begin taking classes online, you will probably show the instructor a certain degree of respect because of his/her position. Or if your child is invited to a play date at a large home in an exclusive neighborhood, you may perceive that the parents are successful and entitled to more respect than those from a more modest neighborhood.</p>
<p class="Text">When communicating with another person, we classify that communication based on the interaction. If we interpret the other person&rsquo;s behavior as off-putting or outside the norm, we are likely to interact with them in a manner that will not foster effective communication.</p>
<p class="Text">And finally, we use our psychological state to classify our interaction. Interactions that make us feel safe are likely to engender further communication with that person.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Interpretation</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Once we&rsquo;ve selected what communication to attend to and have organized it, we must interpret the act of communication. We interpret it more favorably if we are closely involved, emotionally invested, or gain satisfaction from the person with whom we are communicating. For example, business owners having a brainstorming session who get very excited about the process might interpret the meeting as more productive than it really was.</p>
<p class="Text">Other personal experiences also influence how we interpret a communication experience. And our habitual assumptions about human behavior influence how we interpret other people&rsquo;s communication behavior. We tend to interpret communication acts in a way that supports our expectations.</p>
<p class="Text">However, the amount of knowledge we have about our communication partner can also influence the way we interpret their communication. For example, suppose you moved into a new neighborhood and your new neighbor was rude to you. You would probably expect him to always be rude, and you would then react to his behavior as though it supports that expectation. However, if you learn that the neighbor has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy, you might decide that the behavior you previously thought was rude was instead a result of him not feeling well and change your interpretation of the communications. It&rsquo;s all about context!</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Negotiation</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">After we&rsquo;ve selected the stimuli to attend to, organized it, and interpreted it, we use this interpretation to influence other people&rsquo;s perceptions of it. We present reality as we see it. However, when our interpretations clash with other people&rsquo;s, we can either refuse to consider another point of view or try to negotiate a shared understanding. Negotiating a common understanding is essential when preserving a good relationship between communication partners and is the most important factor.</p>
<p class="Text">Romantic partners often have to compromise and negotiate a common understanding to maintain the solidarity in their relationship. However, sometimes communication partners cannot negotiate a common narrative and using your own personal narrative, or interpretation, becomes more important. However, if you feel it is more important to remain true to your convictions than to compromise with your communication partner, It may be necessary to maintain your own personal narrative. For example, if you find out that your coworker is lying about the hours he&rsquo;s working, you probably can&rsquo;t negotiate a shared understanding</p>
