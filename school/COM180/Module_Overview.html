<p class="Text">Proper communication is essential in developing effective relationships as an online student. Miscommunication can cause lots of confusion and misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="Text">You can probably remember playing the game &ldquo;Telephone&rdquo; or &ldquo;Whisper Down the Lane&rdquo; as a child. One person starts with a sentence and whispers it into the ear of the next person, who whispers it to the next person. The sentence travels this way until it reaches the last person, who repeats the sentence to the whole group. Sometimes it may be the original sentence; however, it is amazing how often sentences start out one way and end up completely different. The purpose of the game is to teach children about effective communication.</p>
<p class="Text">As adults, we stay busy spinning a number of different plates and wearing multiple hats. For most of you, being a student is only one of your many roles. Maybe you are fathers and mothers, daughters and sons, full-time employees, members of an organization, volunteers, etc. Life can be demanding and require you to multitask. Within each of your defined roles, you have relationships with individuals. As a parent, your relationship is with your children. As an employee, your relationships are with your coworkers and your boss. These relationships are important. Not managing them effectively could lead to a great deal of confusion, anxiety, and misunderstanding in your relationships.</p>
<p class="Text">As online students, you have relationships with your classmates and online professors, but you rarely have the advantage of seeing them face to face. This means that you must depend on the words that you see in front of you. Let&rsquo;s look at a classic example.</p>
<p class="Text">Here is a basic sentence: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat, Grandma!&rdquo; When you read this sentence, it&rsquo;s apparent that someone is calling Grandma to the table&mdash;it is time to eat. Now look at that same sentence, but take out the comma: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat Grandma!&rdquo; Now this sentence is open to another interpretation. Are they calling Grandma to the table for a meal, or is Grandma the meal?!</p>
