<h2>Communication Strategies</h2>

<p class="Text">Understanding the person you are trying to reach is a fundamental principle of overcoming communication barriers. The more you know about your receiver, the better you are able to deliver your message effectively. Of the many strategies to use in communication, we will address just a few here:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Mirroring</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Empathy</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Active listening</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Metacommunication</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">You will learn how to use the <em>mirroring technique</em> to establish rapport, how to employ <em>empathy</em> to understand your communication partner, how to engage in <em>active listening</em>, and how to use <em>metacommunication</em> to resolve a problem.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Mirroring </span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">One way to improve nonverbal communication is through <em>mirroring</em>, or subtly imitating someone. The most successful mirroring technique is to imitate another person&rsquo;s breathing pattern. If you adjust your own breathing rate to match someone else&rsquo;s, you will soon establish rapport with that individual. Another effective mirroring technique is to adopt the other person&rsquo;s voice speed. If the other person speaks more slowly than you typically do, slow down to mirror him or her.</p>
<p class="Text">In the photo on the right, business associates are demonstrating mirroring behavior. All of the associates are leaning forward. Several associates have their elbows on the table. Some associates are propping their chin with their hand. It&rsquo;s not certain who is mirroring whom. But it <em>is</em> clear that the people are establishing rapport with one another through their mirroring behavior. Imagine if one of these coworkers leaned back in his/her chair with folded arms across the chest. What type of message would this send? Would the other group members feel rapport with this individual? Or would they feel that the member is disinterested?</p>
<p class="Text">In this module, select a friend or family member to practice the mirroring technique. Ask him or her if you can practice interviewing techniques, but do not mention the mirroring technique. While holding the interview with your friend or family member, use the mirroring technique. Imitate the person&rsquo;s breathing pattern, rate of speech, hand movements, eye movements, leg movements, or any other noticeable aspect of behavior. Notice how quickly you establish rapport in your conversation.</p>
<p class="Text">See how well you recognize mirroring behavior in this exercise.</p>

<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Empathy</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Understanding the person you are trying to communicate with is a fundamental principle of overcoming communication barriers. The more you know about your receiver, the better you are able to deliver your message effectively. Developing <em>empathy</em> requires placing yourself in the receiver&rsquo;s shoes. Imagine yourself in the other person&rsquo;s role and assume that person&rsquo;s viewpoint and emotions.</p>
<p class="Text">Often we confuse the terms &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sympathy.&rdquo; When you empathize with someone, you imagine how you would feel if placed in that situation. Sympathy is the act of comforting someone.</p>
<p class="Text">Imagine finding out that you just lost your job. You call your parents or siblings and they offer words of support and encouragement. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find another job; just give it some time.&rdquo; This is sympathy; your loved one wants you to know that you have his or her support through this crisis. Then, you call your best friend who lost her job last year. Your friend can see the circumstance from your perspective. She knows how frightened and powerless you feel. She can see the situation from your perspective; this is empathy.</p>
<p class="Text">Test your understanding of the difference between empathy and sympathy with this activity.</p>

<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Active Listening</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Another strategy in effective interpersonal communication is <em>active listening</em>. The active listener listens intensely, with the goal of empathizing with the speaker. Let&rsquo;s consider some specific active-listening strategies.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Accept the sender&rsquo;s figure of speech.</strong><br /> A useful way of showing empathy is to accept the sender&rsquo;s figure of speech. This makes the sender feel understood and accepted. For example, when a classmate says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stuck&rdquo; on a group project, you could respond, &ldquo;How can I help you get unstuck?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Paraphrase and listen reflectively.</strong><br /> To be an active listener, it is also important to paraphrase, or repeat in your own words, what the sender says, feels, and means. Paraphrasing is also referred to as reflective listening. For example, if the other person says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting through this group project. I wish someone else in our group would pitch in and do a fair day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; you might respond with, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that you do more than your fair share of the group work.&rdquo; Your goal in active listening is to extend the conversation so that you can obtain more useful details (Leftwich, 2005, p. 113).</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Minimize distractions.</strong><br /> To listen actively, minimize distractions so that you are not tempted to glance away from the message sender. Avoid answering a cell phone call. Don&rsquo;t stare at your computer screen while someone is trying to talk to you.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Ask questions.</strong><br /> A major technique of active listening is to ask questions rather than make conclusive statements. Suppose a teammate is late with data that you need to complete your analysis. Instead of saying, &ldquo;I must have your input by Thursday afternoon,&rdquo; try, &ldquo;When will I get your input?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Allow the sender to finish his/her sentence.</strong><br /> Always allow the sender to finish his or her sentence. Be sure to let others speak until they have finished. Do not interrupt by jumping in with advice or offering solutions unless requested. It is important for communicators to be able to complete their thoughts.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Use nonverbal communication.</strong><br /> Active listening also involves nonverbal communication. Your body communicates whether or not you are listening intently. If you tap your fingers on the desk, glance at your computer, or slouch in your chair, you send the message that the other person does not warrant your full attention.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Minimize words that shut down discussion.</strong><br /> Another key part of listening is to keep the conversation flowing. Minimize words that shut down discussion. When you say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; or &ldquo;however,&rdquo; you effectively shut down or limit the conversation. No matter what words follow, the sender receives a message that essentially says, &ldquo;You are wrong and I am right.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text"><strong>Don&rsquo;t lie or fake because you have not been paying attention.</strong><br /> Finally, avoid the need to lie or fake when you have not been paying attention. It is okay to admit that you have not been listening or that you did not catch everything that was said. When this happens, ask the person to repeat or request clarification. Be honest rather than lying or faking your way through a conversation. And start paying attention.</p>
<p class="Text"><strong><span class="SubTitle">Metacommunication</span></strong></p>
<p class="Text">Sometimes the best way to overcome a communication barrier with another person is to describe the nature of the relationship between you at the moment. <em>Metacommunication</em>, or communicating about your communication, helps to overcome barriers or resolve a problem.</p>
<p class="Text">For example, suppose you are a team leader and feeling pressured about your project deadline. You may say to your classmates, &ldquo;I might appear brusque today and tomorrow. Please don&rsquo;t take it personally. It&rsquo;s just that I have to motivate our team to meet the deadline.&rdquo; Explaining how you are communicating can help the other person to understand the message better.<br /> <br /> Leftwich, S. (2005). Now hear this. <em>Black Enterprise, 35</em>(8), 112&ndash;113.</p>
