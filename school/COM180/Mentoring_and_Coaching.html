<h2>Mentoring and Coaching</h2>
<p class="Text">What is a mentoring relationship?</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A unique relationship between two people</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A learning partnership that involves emotional and task-related support</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A reciprocal helping relationship</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A frequently changing relationship between the mentor and the mentored</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">A mentoring relationship may occur at work, at home, or in the community</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">To be prepared to mentor a less-experienced person, or mentee, you should be able to exhibit some of the following behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Sponsoring:</strong> Nominate someone for a promotion or special assignment.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Coaching:</strong> Give advice to a mentee to help him or her develop a skill.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Protecting:</strong> Shield a mentee from a negative situation by giving the person a heads-up.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Sharing challenging assignments:</strong> A mentee might shadow you in learning a difficult task.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Acting as a referral agent:</strong> Help a mentee find a resource in order to handle a problem.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Role modeling:</strong> Display a pattern of values and behaviors that a mentee would want to emulate.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Giving support and encouragement:</strong> Find opportunities to compliment and provide positive feedback to the mentee.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Counseling:</strong> Listen to the mentee&rsquo;s problems and give feedback.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Providing friendship:</strong> A mentee can trust you to keep information he/she shares confidential.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Encouraging problem solving:</strong> Guide a mentee through a problem rather than solving the problem for him or her.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Showing the ropes:</strong> Explain the values and do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts of the task or organization to a mentee.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Teaching the right skills:</strong> Teach necessary personal or technical skills, problem solving, and strategic thinking to a mentee.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>Encouraging continuous learning:</strong> Ask the mentee probing questions to help him or her explore new issues or anticipate problems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">As you can see from this list, mentoring can happen both formally and informally. Which behaviors could you begin to implement now? Are you already mentoring someone through one of these behaviors? Remember, mentoring relationships occur both at work and in our families or social networks.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="SubTitle">Coaching Technique Case Study</span></p>
<p class="Text">Next, we will focus on techniques that an effective coach uses.</p>
<p class="Text">Meet Chloe, a sales associate at a retail store. Chloe has developed effective coaching skills as a sales associate. After working at the store for three years, she was recently promoted to lead sales clerk. Other store employees look to Chloe for advice and she has been establishing rapport with them. They feel comfortable talking to Chloe. She has demonstrated to them that she is trustworthy. Chloe has worked hard to <em>build relationships</em> with the store employees, which is the first step in becoming an effective coach.</p>
<p class="Text">Now meet Taylor. The employees at the retail store are frustrated with Taylor, who has been coming into work late for the last week. One employee says, &ldquo;Taylor, you don&rsquo;t seem all that interested in being here.&rdquo; Another says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been letting the team down.&rdquo; These general statements leave Taylor feeling as if his coworkers don&rsquo;t value him.</p>
<p class="Text">As a coach, Chloe realizes that Taylor needs more <em>specific feedback</em> about the behavior that is upsetting his coworkers. She pulls him aside and says, &ldquo;Taylor, I noticed you&rsquo;ve been coming into work late this week. When you come to work late, the rest of the team has to do your work and they start to feel resentful.&rdquo; Taylor is more open to Chloe&rsquo;s feedback because it focuses on his specific behavior, which doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as threatening as those who chalked him up as aloof and inconsiderate.</p>
<p class="Text">Chloe adds, &ldquo;You used to come into work early, so I know this is not your normal pattern. I know you have the ability to get here on time.&rdquo; Notice that Chloe references positive aspects of Taylor&rsquo;s past performance. A coach is effective at communicating <em>positive feedback</em> with negative feedback. A coach believes that the junior person such as Taylor can improve his performance.</p>
<p class="Text">Taylor admits that he has been coming to work late because he started a gym membership and he&rsquo;s been working out in the morning. Chloe suggests, &ldquo;You could go to the gym after work so that it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with this job.&rdquo; Chloe intentionally used <em>&ldquo;could&rdquo;</em> instead of <em>&ldquo;should&rdquo;</em> to present her suggestion as a choice for Taylor to accept or reject. She hopes that Taylor will think about what they&rsquo;ve talked about and decide to do the right thing.</p>
<p class="Text">Chloe ends her day and heads home. Good coaching skills do not only occur within the context of work, they occur in our personal relationships too, especially when we are offering counsel to someone who is not as far along as we are.</p>
<p class="Text">When Chloe arrives home, her younger sister, Anna, confides in her. Anna is upset with her new husband, Mark. Anna mentioned to Mark that she&rsquo;d love to be able to start decorating their spare room for use as a nursery, and Mark scoffed at the idea. He feels it is too early in the marriage to consider having a baby, and joked about how stressful and unhappy their lives would be with a baby. Anna is disappointed that her husband didn&rsquo;t take the issue seriously. She feels hurt and rejected by his reaction, afraid that he may never want to have children together. She abruptly leaves the house and goes to see her big sister, Chloe.</p>
<p class="Text">After listening to her sister, Chloe asks, &ldquo;Anna, can you think of any reasons Mark would not feel comfortable discussing children at this point? Are there any issues in his own childhood that may be effecting his reaction?&rdquo; Chloe <em>asks powerful<strong> </strong>questions</em> that Anna hadn&rsquo;t thought of. These questions are effective in providing a springboard for Anna to think more deeply about what might be bothering Mark and how to approach this issue.</p>
<p class="Text">Chloe has an idea about why Mark would be uncomfortable with having children so early in the marriage, based on prior experience. She <em>interprets what happened</em>, which is an effective technique in coaching. &ldquo;Anna, maybe Mark is worried that his own child will grow up feeling deprived, as he did, if you two don&rsquo;t finish school and establish yourselves before having children. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not that he doesn&rsquo;t want children with you&mdash;maybe he wants to build a sense of security first.&rdquo; Chloe&rsquo;s interpretation helps Anna see the situation from an angle she hadn&rsquo;t considered.</p>
<p class="Text">Then, Chloe follows up with <em>constructive advice</em>. &ldquo;First, you need to talk to him directly about this issue, and not jump to conclusions. Pick a time when you are both ready to listen and hear each other with no distractions. Perhaps you and Mark could sit down and work out a life plan together, a list of goals and a timetable for when you would like to start your family, and what each of you wishes to accomplish first.&rdquo; Anna feels her confidence boosted after the conversation. She feels less rejected and more certain that this is a problem that she can address and work through in her marriage.</p>
<p class="Text">Chloe notices that her sister seems happier in her marriage. A coach <em>applauds good results</em>, so Chloe looks for an opportunity to encourage Anna: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you and Mark have been able to talk more about your struggles, instead of assuming the worst about each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Text">Review the chart and compare Chloe&rsquo;s actions to the steps illustrated.</p>
