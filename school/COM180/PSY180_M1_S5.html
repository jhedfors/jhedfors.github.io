<h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p class="Text">Emotional intelligence is a very important component of interpersonal effectiveness. Emotions are feelings or states that convey information about relationships. Intelligence is defined as the capability to reason validly about information. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, interpret, and respond appropriately to your own emotions and those of other people.</p>
<p class="Text">To demonstrate emotional intelligence, you need to be able to recognize, monitor, and then understand your emotions and how they affect your behavior. For example, when you feel stress, perhaps you also feel irritable. When you find yourself becoming irritable, you can begin to recognize that you need to moderate your stress. This recognition will help you to proactively change your behaviors so that you will be more effective in your interactions with others!</p>
<p class="Text">In addition, you also need to be able to recognize, read, and understand the non-verbal behavior of other people with whom you interact, so that you can understand their emotions and their behaviors and moderate your responses.</p>
<p class="Text"><span>Another aspect of emotional intelligence is the ability to demonstrate self-control and delay gratification. People with high emotional intelligence are able to recognize their desires, but they demonstrate restraint when choosing to act. They tend to think before they act, considering consequences carefully. Those with high emotional intelligence will often put off pleasure or gratification to work toward a more important goal. For example, the decision to finish your schoolwork tonight, rather than watching TV, or going out with friends, suggests high emotional intelligence.</span><br /> <br /> So how can emotional intelligence improve interpersonal effectiveness? Understanding emotional intelligence allows you to process information by recognizing emotional responses in yourself and others. People who process emotions well tend to be more socially skilled and interpersonally effective.</p>
