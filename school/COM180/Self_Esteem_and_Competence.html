<h2><strong>Self-Esteem Development</strong></h2>
<p class="Text">Part of understanding the nature of self-esteem is to understand where it comes from. Self-esteem develops, changes, and evolves throughout your life based on your interactions with people, events, and things. Early life experiences play a key role in the development of both healthy self-esteem and low self-esteem.</p>
<p class="Text">Childhood experiences that lead to a healthy self-esteem include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Being praised for positive behavior and accomplishments</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Being listened to</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Being spoken to respectfully</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Getting attention and hugs</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Experiencing success in sports and school</li>
</ul>
<p class="Text">In adulthood, your self-esteem may be boosted by a key accomplishment. A 44-year-old woman who was studying to become a licensed practical nurse said that her self-esteem increased when she received an A in a pharmacology course. Negative events such as being laid off or not being able to find new employment can also influence self-esteem, of course.</p>
<p class="Text">How&rsquo;s your self-esteem? Try taking the Human Relations Self-Assessment Quiz found in your textbook (Quiz 3.1), a series of questions for you to answer as &ldquo;mostly true&rdquo; or &ldquo;mostly false.&rdquo; Your score can tell you more about your level of self-esteem.</p>
<p class="Text">Thoughts to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Did your quiz score match your initial evaluation of your self-esteem?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If your score indicates that you have low self-esteem, consider strategies to boost your self-esteem. What person(s) with high self-esteem would you model? What person(s) would you find to boost your self-esteem? What personal strengths do you need to focus on more often? How would you rebut your inner critic? How would you practice self-nurturing?</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">If your score indicates that you have high self-esteem, consider whether your behavior diminishes others in order to preserve a higher status. Do you criticize group members in front of others? Do you intentionally ignore others? Do you talk down to people? Do you give others the silent treatment? Have you belittled someone recently? What steps could you take this week to improve these behaviors?</li>
