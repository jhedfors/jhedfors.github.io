<h2><strong>Intrinsic|Extrinsic Rewards</strong></h2>
<p class="Text">Motivation can also be viewed in terms of rewards, which can be either intrinsic or extrinsic.</p>
<p class="Text">Intrinsic rewards are benefits that are internal to the person, such as personal satisfaction or a feeling of accomplishment. Intrinsic rewards occur when people engage in activities that don&rsquo;t have obvious external rewards, such as hobbies.</p>
<p class="Text">There are two forms of intrinsic motivation; one is based on enjoyment and the other is based on obligation. Engaging in a friendship is driven by the intrinsic value of the enjoyment that you gain from the sense of connection and belonging. Helping that friend move is probably driven more by the obligation to help a good friend.</p>
<p class="Text">Extrinsic rewards are rewards that come from outside the person. These incentives can include tangible items like money or trophies, or intangible things like praise. For example, in sports, the crowd might cheer for an athlete, providing him or her an intangible reward, and the winning athlete might get a trophy, which is a tangible incentive. Competition can also act as an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to do well for the sake of winning rather than for the sake of enjoyment. And finally, the threat of punishment or the loss of attention can be a form of extrinsic motivation. <br /><br /></p>
